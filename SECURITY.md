# Security policy

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Basti project.

## Supported versions

Basti releases follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), so it's recommended to always use
the latest release within your major version to experience stability, performance, and security.

The latest major version will receive all the security updates. Previous major releases will only
receive the most critical security patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities in GitHub issues.** Instead, use the "Security" tab on GitHub
to secretly report the vulnerability directly to the author. The details will be disclosed only after
the security patch is released. You will also be mentioned in the credits ü§ù
